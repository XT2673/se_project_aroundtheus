# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**And now... a few words from the Dev**

Hey, everyone! Julian here with another project I built during my time in the Triple Ten Program! This project was the first with the training wheels pretty much taken off and I gotta say, was a lot of fun to do.

So... what have we learned from this project?

1. Responsive layouts can be a bit tricky, but dev tools have very quickly become my new best friend! Even learning new tools within the suite ,like "Network" when deploying pages from Github, helped tackle a few issues with some CSS files not loading properly (to which I facepalmed and corrected the case-sensitive issue immediately, all while swearing under my breath. I hear making rookie mistakes and swearing under your breath while correcting them is a common thing, so I'll fit right in!).

2. Figma is a powerful design tool! I've used it in the past for vector art, but never considered how versatile it could actually be when building a web page (or really any page for that matter).

**What can be done to improve this project?**

I think allowing the students to improve upon the Sprint 0 project by using this as the layout for them to build on (basically, they'd have to start building a social media page) would be a fun twist that allows them to be creative while still giving them clear guidelines that the project calls for. Maybe future students will get to have that opportunity.

**IN CONCLUSION**

I've been enjoying these projects and moreso the skills I've been learning along the way!

I am now an HTML/CSS dev! Now... what to do with this newfound power? Will I use it for good? Or... will I take over the world?!
_"Uh... that's not how that works.."_
Oh... Well, then... I guess, uh... I'll just use it for good, then...

ONTO THE NEXT LESSON!!

**Project 4 JavaScript!**

I'm back with more updates! This time, we're adding JavaScript to the page. So exciting!

_What is JavaScript?_

From the powerful Wikipedia: "JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code."

In my own words: Going back to the house building analogy I used in my video above, if HTML is the Rough-in and CSS is the Trim-out, JS is like programming the SmartHome device you most likely have in your new home. Every button you press on a page that opens up a mini window on the page? Animations? Those annoying ads that pop up when and where you least expect or even want them to? You have JavaScript to thank for that. No, don't boo just because I mentioned ads! Sheesh...

Through the power of this wonderful bit of scripting code, this project is a lot more dynamic.

FOR EXAMPLE:

The Edit button now pops up a modal that allows you to change the name and description. The 'X' on the modal 'closes' that element (uhm, ACTUALLY, the modal has a modifier class that the Edit button 'turns on' and the 'X' button 'turns off'). The 'Submit' button will save the changes to the profile and close the modal (same thing as the 'X' button, but with extra steps).

AND ALSO:
The images that were first added in from last Sprint (since this is multiple Sprints in one project), are now added dynamically through the use of a data array in js. This allows for end-users to (eventually) be able to change the cards to fit what they want to share!

_Challenges_

Javascript is a logical language, meaning you have to be able to create a path using logic statements to create your code. Query Selectors, functions, event handlers and listeners, and the many different methods used to get these to work in unison are what makes this so tough to learn. I've come to learn repetition and practice are useful skills with learning js. As is researching, even going to GPT for a quick 'hey, I'm trying to do _x_. If I do _y_, will it work? And if not, what approach should I be taking?' I've also learned that I'm really _REALLY_ bad at overthinking and overcomplicating it, but I've also learned how to correct that behavior, which has helped tremendously.

It's been a challenge, for sure. Especially learning the DOM (or Document Object Model).

**IN CONCLUSION**

Javascript is one of the three main languages used for building a webpage. Like a programmable Smarthome, it allows for a more dynamic, interactive, and flexible page. With some patience and effort, it's a fun language to learn, albiet tricky to understand at first.
